abstract = {Building extraction is a component of many environmental modelling and data analysis applications. It is however data and knowledge intensive. We investigate the use of publicly available data from Google Earth and OpenStreetMap and of neural networks for this task. We evaluate different candidate algorithms for the case of building extraction on the island of Bali.},
