abstract: In this paper, we consider trusted content delivery in a large-scale SIC-enabled wireless network in the presence of trust degree information. The trust degree of a node quantifies a degree of its trustworthiness, and we model the network with multiple tiers based on the trust degrees of nodes. To improve the successful receive probability of an authentic file, we adopt a simple but effective serving node selection rule based on maximum long-term biased-received-power (BRP), and a decoding method based on successive interference cancellation (SIC). First, by utilizing tools from stochastic geometry, we derive a tractable expression and a closed-form expression for the successful receive probability, in the general and small (file transmission) rate regimes, respectively. The analytical results indicate that the advantage of SIC in the general rate regime increases with the number of interferers that can be cancelled …
