abstract: Existing multicasting schemes for massive content delivery do not
  fully utilize multicasting opportunities in delay tolerant content-oriented
  applications. In this paper, we propose a novel temporal-spatial
  aggregation-based multicasting scheme in a large-scale cache-enabled wireless
  network. The proposed scheme can efficiently exploit multicasting
  opportunities in asynchronous content requests to improve spectral efficiency.
  By making use of the delay tolerance of elastic services, the proposed scheme
  achieves a better energy-throughput-delay tradeoff. Utilizing tools from
  stochastic geometry, we derive a tractable expression for the successful
  transmission probability in the general region. Using asymptotic
  approximations, we derive closed form successful transmission probabilities in
  the large delay region as well as the large and small user density regions.
  The asymptotic results reveal that the successful transmission probability
  increases and the energy consumption decreases at the cost of delay increase
  in these asymptotic regions. The analysis in this paper provides a new
  understanding of the energy-throughput-delay tradeoff for massive content
  delivery in large-scale cache-enabled wireless networks.
